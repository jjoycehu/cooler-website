Created a dashboard in Tableau to inform San Diego council members of the effectiveness of the ”Get it Done” app pertaining to potholes on the road. Created visualizations for San Diego residents to view city responsiveness to their pothole fix-it requests, and to visualize how pothole trends may be influenced by rain, location, and time.
